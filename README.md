# Sobel Filter Neural Network

This project implements a neural network that learns to apply a Sobel filter to images. The network is trained on a dataset of input images and their corresponding Sobel-filtered outputs.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv ml_env
   source ml_env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `ml_env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install torch torchvision matplotlib opencv-python numpy
   ```

## Usage

### 1. Visualize Sobel Operator

To see how the Sobel operator works on a sample image:

```
python sobel_operator.py
```

This script will display the original image and the Sobel-filtered version side by side.

### 2. Train the Model

To train the neural network:

```
python train.py
```

This script will:
- Load the CIFAR10 dataset
- Create a custom SobelDataset
- Train the SobelNet model
- Save the best model as `best_sobel_model.pth`

### 3. Test the Model

To test the trained model on a random image:

```
python test.py
```

This script will:
- Load a random test image from CIFAR10
- Resize it to a random size between 32x32 and 256x256
- Apply the trained model and the actual Sobel filter
- Display the results and calculate the Mean Squared Error

### 4. Compare Filters

To compare the learned filter with the actual Sobel kernel:

```
python compare_filters.py
```

This script will visualize the learned filter and the Sobel kernel side by side, and calculate the Mean Squared Error between them.

## Design Considerations

1. **Network Architecture**: A simple 3-layer convolutional neural network (SobelNet) is used. This lightweight architecture is sufficient for learning the Sobel filter operation.

2. **Variable Image Sizes**: The SobelDataset class supports variable image sizes, allowing the model to generalize to different input dimensions.

3. **Reflection Padding**: The convolutional layers use reflection padding to handle edge cases, ensuring consistent output sizes.

4. **Early Stopping**: The training process implements early stopping to prevent overfitting and reduce unnecessary computation.

5. **Learning Rate Scheduling**: A learning rate scheduler is used to adjust the learning rate during training, helping to fine-tune the model's performance.

6. **Model Compilation**: The trained model is compiled using torch.jit.script for faster inference.

7. **Visualization**: Various scripts are provided to visualize the Sobel operator, test results, and compare the learned filter with the actual Sobel kernel.

These design choices aim to create a flexible, efficient, and interpretable implementation of a Sobel filter neural network.

This README provides a comprehensive guide on how to set up the environment, run the various scripts, and understand the design considerations behind the implementation. It covers all the main aspects of your project, including the sample Sobel operator visualization, training, testing, and filter comparison.
